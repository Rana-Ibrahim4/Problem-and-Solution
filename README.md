#### Solutions:
1. Upgrade your computer with more memory and more storage space.
2. Use a lighter alternative operating system such as Ubuntu Minimal or Lubuntu.
3. Install the ROS on another machine you have or host it on a virtual server.
4. Use cloud service to run ROS add from local selection.solution

### The another Solution :
#### How to use ROS development studio
ROS Development Studio is an interactive development environment for the Robot Operating System (ROS) developed by Canonical. This environment allows developers to write, test, and execute ROS programs directly from the browser without the need to install ROS locally on their computer.

##### There are a few basic steps to using ROS Development Studio:

1. Accessing ROS Development Studio: You can access ROS Development Studio through the link https://rds.canonical.com/ from any web browser.

2. Creating a new project: After accessing the site, click on “New Project” to create a new ROS project.

3. Selecting a project template: ROS Development Studio provides a set of ready-made templates to start a project, such as “Turtlebot3 Simulation” or “ROS Beginner Tutorials”.

4. Editing the code: In the editor area, you can write and edit the code for the ROS program you want to develop.

5. Building and running the program: Use the available build and run buttons in the interface to build and run your program on the virtual environment.

6. Browsing the results: You can view the results and outputs generated by running the program in the different tab sections.

7. Sharing the project: If you want to share your project with others, you can save it and obtain a link that can be shared.

In this way, you can start developing and testing ROS programs without the need to install ROS locally on your computer. ROS Development Studio provides an easy-to-use and customizable environment for developing ROS applications.

#### How to install ROS Jetson Nano

##### Installing ROS on a Jetson Nano involves the following steps:

1. Download the Jetson Nano SD card image:
   * Go to the NVIDIA Jetson download page (https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) and download the latest JetPack for Jetson Nano.
   *  Follow the instructions to flash the Jetson Nano SD card image onto an SD card.

2. Set up the Jetson Nano hardware:
   *  Insert the SD card into the Jetson Nano board.
   *  Connect the Jetson Nano to power, a display, keyboard, and mouse.
   *  Boot up the Jetson Nano.

3. Install ROS:
   * Open a terminal on the Jetson Nano.
   * Add the ROS package repository to your system's sources list:
     
     ex Git:
     ```
         sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
     ```
        *  Set up your keys:
        * 
          ex Git :
         ```sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
         ```
        * Update the package lists:
          
        ex Git :
         ```sudo apt-get update
         ```
        * Install the ROS distribution you want, e.g., ROS Noetic:
          
        ex Git : 
         ```sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-desktop-full
         ```
        * Initialize the ROS environment:
        ex Git :
         ```source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
         ```
        * Install additional ROS dependencies:
          
        ex Git :
         ``` sudo apt-get install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
         ```
        * Initialize rosdep:
          
        ex Git :
     ``` sudo rosdep init
     rosdep update
     ```
     
4. Test the ROS installation:
   * Run the following command to start the ROS master:
     ex Git:
     ```
     roscore
     ```
     * In a new terminal, run the following command to see if ROS is working:
        ex Git:
        ```
        rosrun roscpp_tutorials talker
        ```
     * You should see the "hello world" message being published.
